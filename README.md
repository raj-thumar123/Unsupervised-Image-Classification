# Unsupervised-Image-Classification
Unsupervised image classification is a vital area of machine learning, aiming to identify patterns and structure in unlabeled data. Unlike supervised learning, where labeled datasets are essential, unsupervised techniques leverage intrinsic data features to perform classification, clustering, or dimensionality reduction.
